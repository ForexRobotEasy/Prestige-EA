## Code Overview

The Prestige EA is an Expert Advisor (EA) that utilizes a neural network for analyzing market data and making trading decisions. The EA includes the following key components:

1. **Libraries**: The necessary libraries are included at the beginning of the code to provide access to the Trade and Neuro classes.

2. **Global Variables**: The Trade and Neuro objects are declared as global variables for easy access throughout the code.

3. **OnInit() Function**: This function is called during EA initialization and performs the following tasks:
   - Initializes the neural network using the `Neuro.Initialize()` function.
   - Loads historical market data for training using the `Neuro.LoadData()` function.
   - Trains the neural network with the loaded data using the `Neuro.Train()` function.
   - Prints the training results using the `Neuro.PrintResults()` function.

4. **OnTick() Function**: This function is called on every tick and performs the following tasks:
   - Retrieves the current market price using the `SymbolInfoDouble()` function.
   - Analyzes the market data using the trained neural network with the `Neuro.Analyze()` function.
   - Makes trading decisions based on the analysis:
     - If the predicted price is higher than the current price, a buy order is executed using the `Trade.Buy()` function.
     - If the predicted price is lower than the current price, a sell order is executed using the `Trade.Sell()` function.

5. **OnDeinit() Function**: This function is called during EA deinitialization and performs cleanup tasks:
   - Cleans up resources used by the neural network with the `Neuro.Cleanup()` function.

6. **start() Function**: This is the entry point of the EA and performs the following tasks:
   - Checks if the EA is enabled using the `Trade.IsEnabled()` function.
   - Calls the `OnTick()` function to check for market conditions and execute trades.
   - Monitors the performance of the EA using the `Trade.GetProfitability()`, `Trade.GetWinRate()`, and `Trade.GetDrawdown()` functions.
   - Prints the performance metrics.
